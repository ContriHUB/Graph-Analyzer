# Contributing to Graph Analyzer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Graph Analyzer**! We welcome contributions from the community, whether itâ€™s fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation. Before you start contributing, please take a moment to read these guidelines.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Issues
- Before starting any work, **please check for open issues**. If an issue already exists for the work you'd like to contribute, make sure it's assigned to you before proceeding.
- If you find a bug or have a feature request but do not see it listed, feel free to open a new issue.
- **You can only raise a Pull Request (PR) if the issue is assigned to you**. So, make sure to get the issue assigned first by commenting on the issue and waiting for confirmation from a maintainer.
  
### 2. Fork the Repository
- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Graph-Analyzer.git
  cd Graph-Analyzer
  ```

### 3. Set Up Your Environment
- Ensure you have Python, Django, OpenCV, and other dependencies set up. Follow the instructions in the [README](README.md) for installation and setup.

### 4. Work on Your Feature or Fix
- Create a new branch for your work:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-name
  ```
- Make sure your code is well-documented and follows the existing code style.
- Run tests and ensure everything works properly before submitting your PR.

### 5. Commit and Push
- Make sure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.
- Push your changes to your fork:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add feature or fix description"
  git push origin feature-name
  ```

### 6. Create a Pull Request
- Once your changes are ready, open a Pull Request from your feature branch to the main branch of the main repository.
- In your PR description, include the issue number (e.g., `Closes #123`) and a brief explanation of your changes.
- Be patient! Maintainers will review your PR, provide feedback if needed, and merge it when ready.
